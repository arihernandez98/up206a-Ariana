### About Me
Hi all! I'm Ariana Hernandez and I am a second year MURP. I am originally from Palmdale, CA but now call Sacramento, CA my home. I am mostly interested in environmental justice and planning predominantly focusing on drinking water and wastewater services in rural/unincorporated areas of California. I am currently a GSR for the Luskin Center of Innovation where I focus on these topics. I enjoy taking walks, hanging out with my friends and cats, and going new places. 

### Course Description 
The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in planning? We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced geoprocessing will be introduced. All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.

In addition to the programming lab sessions, you will be given weekly or bi-weekly "thinking cap" assignments, where you will be asked to think critically about contemporary urban issues. Be prepared to address various topics from the perspective of your own lived experiences, how it informs the topic, and what kind of research can advance knowledge in a positive way.

While there are no prerequisites for taking this course, people who are approaching programming for the first time will admittedly find the course to be intense and challenging.

### Project Ideas
* Mapping Septic Systems in California  *(this is honestly not possible given the lack of data but we can dream)*
* Mapping projects funded by the [Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership program](https://lwcfcoalition.org/orlp)
  * Looking at park equity data for my capstone
  
### Objectives 
I want to be able to think through spatial analysis. I've used ArcGIS before but feel like I just go through the motions of creating maps and don't truly know the mechanics behind it. Hopefully for this course, I increase my GIS skills and can use what I learn through the course in my capstone and then career. I also would like to feel confident in using Python.
